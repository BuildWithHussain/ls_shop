"""Bulk product import: a downloadable spreadsheet template, and the importer that reads one back.

One spreadsheet row is one colour/size combination (a future SKU). Rows sharing a Product Title
become one product, created through the same catalog.create_product engine the single-product
dialog uses — this module never touches Item / Style Attribute Configurator directly. Price is a
create_product-level concept (one price for the whole product, not per size), so every row for one
product must agree on it.
